;;; Simple utils to define unit tests.
;;;
;;; signalsp - returns a signaled condition of specified type or nil.
;;; assert-error - asserts that a form will signal an error.
;;; macro-error - returns an error cased by macroexpanding a form or nil.
;;; assert-macro-error - asserts that a form signals an error at macroexpansion time.
;;; deftest - has a defun like signal and registers the function as unit test.
