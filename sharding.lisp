;; If the environment variable TEST_SHARD_STATUS_FILE is set,

;; If set, TEST_SHARD_STATUS_FILE is guaranteed to be outside of TEST_TMPDIR.

;; If no methods are run on a given shard, the binary must exit in success.
;;
;; The sharding function must be stable:
;; Running the same binary with the same shard number and total shard number
;; must execute the same set of test methods each time.
;;
;; The sharding function must be complete:
;; Across all the shards, each test must be run at least once.
;;
;; The sharding function must be a partition:
;; Across all the shards, each test must be run at most once.
